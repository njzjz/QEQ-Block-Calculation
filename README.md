# QEQ's block calculation study.
**Note: Blocking does not speed up the calculation of QEQ.**

After running [calculateerror.py](calculateerror.py), we found errors of QEQ block can be tolerated.

However, we found blocking does not speed up the calculation of QEQ. This may be because the complexity of QEQ is **o(N)**, so the block cannot speed up its calculations.
